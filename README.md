# material-ripple
Short vanilla js script for material ripple effect on click (inspired by Tommaso Poletti from codepen)

To use: Just add data-animation="ripple" to element you want to have ripple effect. PS: That element has to be element with closing tag (ex: it can't be used on input field)

For now, you set color and speed of animation inside javascript (variable speed and color), but it will be dynamically soon.
