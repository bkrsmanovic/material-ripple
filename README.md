# material-ripple
Short vanilla js script for material ripple effect on click (inspired by Tommaso Poletti from codepen)

To use: Just add data-animation="ripple" to element you want to have ripple effect. PS: That element has to be element with closing tag (ex: it can't be used on input field)

Options:

data-speed="2000" //Speed in miliseconds (default is 700)

data-color="rgba(0, 0, 0, .6)" //Any color value (hash, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla... - default is rgba(255, 255, 255 .8))

For now, you set default color and speed of animation inside javascript (variable speed and color), or change them in html tag
